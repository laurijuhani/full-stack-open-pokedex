Using Java in a CI pipeline typically involves tools like Checkstyle for linting, JUnit for testing, and Maven or Gradle for building, 
with CI alternatives including GitLab CI, CircleCI, and Bitbucket Pipelines.

Let’s consider a Java-based application being developed by a six people team. In a typical CI setup, we’d want to automate code quality checks, testing, and building.

For linting, Java devs often use Checkstyle or PMD. For unit testing, JUnit is the standard, with Mockito often used for mocking dependencies. 
Building the project can be handled by Maven or Gradle, both of which also integrate well with testing and dependency management.

Jenkins and GitHub actions are popular for CI/CD, some alternatives include:
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
- Bitbucket Pipelines
- Drone CI

When deciding between a self-hosted vs cloud-based CI setup, key factors include:
- Team’s expertise in managing infrastructure.
- Security/compliance needs.
- Scalability and cost. Cloud CI platforms often scale automatically but may have usage costs.
- Internet access. Some enterprise environments restrict outbound access and might prefer on-prem solutions.

For a small team preparing to launch, cloud-based CI is usually more practical: it’s quicker to set up, easier to maintain, and lets the team focus on delivering features rather than managing infrastructure.
